# What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is the capability of a computer to learn and recognize patterns. For example, consider a shopkeeper who needs to record the daily loan data of his customers.
Recording hundreds of records manually is challenging, and hiring someone would come with its own limitations (such as computational capacity, time management, and employee availability). 
Instead, he could buy a computer system and train a model to recognize people and their loan amounts. This approach would not only make things easier for him but also help accomplish tasks
in a timely and efficient manner.
# AI and DataScience
Data science combines statistical tools, methods, and technology to generate meaning from data. Artificial Intelligence takes this one step further and uses the data to solve cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, pattern recognition, and human-like expression.
## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
####  Goal: 
The primary goal of AI is to create systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
#### Methods: 
AI involves a variety of techniques such as machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, robotics, and expert systems.
#### Applications: 
AI is used in a wide range of applications including autonomous vehicles, speech and image recognition, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, and game playing.
#### Focus:
AI focuses on creating intelligent agents that can autonomously perform tasks and make decisions.
#### Example: 
Developing a self-driving car that can navigate through traffic, make decisions based on its surroundings, and learn from new driving scenarios.
## Data Science
#### Goal: 
The primary goal of Data Science is to extract meaningful insights and knowledge from data. It involves analyzing and interpreting complex data to help inform decision-making.
#### Methods: 
Data Science uses statistical analysis, data mining, machine learning, data visualization, and big data technologies to analyze data.
#### Applications: 
Data Science is used in business intelligence, healthcare analytics, financial forecasting, market analysis, and scientific research.
#### Focus: 
Data Science focuses on data manipulation, analysis, and visualization to derive actionable insights.
#### Example: 
Analyzing customer purchase data to identify trends, preferences, and patterns that can inform marketing strategies and business decisions.
